<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>This discussion of the characters of Pinus is an attempt to determine
their taxonomic significance and their utility for determining the
limits of the species. A systematic arrangement follows, based on the
evolution of the cone and seed from the comparatively primitive
conditions that appear in Pinus cembra to the specialized cone and
peculiar dissemination of Pinus radiata and its associates. This
arrangement involves no radical change in existing systems. The new
associations in which some of the species appear are the natural result
of another point of view.</p>

<p>Experience with Mexican species has led me to believe that a Pine can
adapt itself to various climatic conditions and can modify its growth in
response to them. Variations in dimensions of leaf or cone, the number
of leaves in the fascicle, the presence of pruinose branchlets, etc.,
which have been thought to imply specific distinctions, are often the
evidence of facile adaptability. In fact such variations, in correlation
with climatic variation, may argue, not for specific distinction, but
for specific identity. The remarkable variation in the species may be
attributed partly to this adaptability, partly to a participation, more
or less pronounced, in the evolutionary processes that culminate in the
serotinous Pines.</p>

<h2>PART I</h2>

<h2>CHARACTERS OF THE GENUS</h2>


<h3>THE COTYLEDON. <a href="#plate1">Plate I</a>, figs. 1-3.</h3>

<p>The upper half of the embryo in Pinus is a cylindrical fascicle of 4 to
15 cotyledons (fig.&nbsp;1). The cross-section of a cotyledon is, therefore,
a triangle whose angles vary with the number composing the fascicle.
Sections from fascicles of 10 and of 5 cotyledons are shown in figs. 2
and 3. Apart from this difference cotyledons are much alike. Their
number varies and is indeterminate for all species, while any given
number is common to so many species that the character is of no value.</p>


<h3>THE PRIMARY LEAF. <a href="#plate1">Plate I</a>, figs. 4-6.</h3>

<p>Primary leaves follow the cotyledons immediately (fig.&nbsp;4) and assume the
usual functions of foliage for a limited period, varying from one to
three years, secondary fascicles appearing here and there in their
axils. With the permanent appearance of the secondary leaves the green
primaries disappear and their place is taken by bud-scales, which in the
spring and summer persist as scarious bracts, each subtending a fascicle
of secondary leaves. At this stage the bracts present two important
distinctions.</p>

<p>The two sections of the genus, Haploxylon and Diploxylon, established by
Koehne on the single and double fibro-vascular bundle of the leaf, are
even more accurately characterized by these two forms of
bract-insertion. The difference between them, however, is most obvious
on long branchlets with wide intervals between the leaf-fascicles.</p>

<p>The bracts of spring-shoots are the scarious bud-scales of the previous
winter; but the bracts of summer-shoots have the form and green color of
the primary leaf.</p>


<h3>THE BUD. <a href="#plate1">Plate I</a>, figs. 7-11.</h3>

<p>The winter-bud is an aggregate of minute buds, each concealed in the
axil of a primary leaf converted into a scarious, more or less
fimbriate, bud-scale. Buds from which normal growth develops appear only
at the nodes of the branches. On uninodal branchlets they form an apical
group consisting of a terminal bud with a whorl of subterminal buds
about its base. On multinodal branchlets the inner nodes bear lateral
buds which may be latent.</p>

<p>Fig. 7 represents a magnified bud of P. resinosa, first immersed in
alcohol to dissolve the resin, then deprived of its scales. This bud
contains both fascicle-buds, destined for secondary leaves, and larger
paler buds at its base. These last are incipient staminate flowers,
sufficiently developed for recognition. Such flower-bearing buds are
characteristic of the Hard Pines in distinction from the Soft Pines
whose staminate flowers cannot be identified in the bud.</p>

<p>The want of complete data leaves the invariability of this distinction
in question, but with all species that I have examined, the flowers of
Hard Pines are further advanced at the end of the summer. In the
following year they open earlier than those of Soft Pines in the same
locality. The staminate flowers of some Hard Pines (resinosa,
sylvestris, etc.,) are not apparent without removing the bud-scales,
but, with most Hard Pines, they form enlargements of the bud (fig.&nbsp;9).</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span></p>

<p>Invisible or latent buds are present at the nodes and at the apex of
dwarf shoots. The former are the origin of the numerous shoots that
cover the trunk and branches of P. rigida, leiophylla and a few other
species (fig.&nbsp;10). The latter develop into shoots in the centre of a
leaf-fascicle (fig.&nbsp;11) when the branchlet, bearing the fascicle, has
been injured.</p>

<p>The size, color and form of buds, the presence of resin in quantity,
etc., assist in the diagnosis of species. Occasionally a peculiar bud,
like that of P. palustris, may be recognized at once.</p>


<h3>THE BRANCHLET. <a href="#plate1">Plate I</a>, figs. 12-14.</h3>

<p>The branchlet, as here understood, is the whole of a season's growth
from a single bud, and may consist of a single internode (uninodal, fig.
12-a) or of two or more internodes (multinodal, fig.&nbsp;13), each internode
being defined by a leafless base and a terminal node of buds.</p>

<p>The spring-shoot is uninodal in all Soft Pines and in many Hard Pines,
but, in P. taeda and its allies and in species with serotinous cones, it
is more or less prevalently multinodal.</p>

<p>The uninodal spring-shoot may remain so throughout the growing season
and become a uninodal branchlet. Or a summer-shoot may appear on
vigorous branches of any species with the result of converting a
uninodal spring-shoot into an imperfect multinodal branchlet. The
summer-shoot may be recognized, during growth, by its green, not
scarious bracts and, at the end of the season, by the imperfect growth
of its wood and foliage (fig.&nbsp;14).</p>

<p>The perfect multinodal branchlet is formed in the winter-bud (fig.&nbsp;8-a)
and the spring-shoot is multinodal. It is gradually evolved among the
Hard Pines, where it may be absent, rare, frequent or prevalent,
according to the species. In fact there is, in Pinus, an evolutionary
tendency toward multinodal growth, with its beginnings in the
summer-shoot and its culmination in the multinodal winter-bud, most
prevalent among the serotinous Pines.</p>

<p>The multinodal shoot is never invariable in a species, but is rare,
common or prevalent. This condition prevents its employment for grouping
species. For Pines are not sharply divided into multinodal and uninodal
species, and no exact segregation of them, based on this difference, is
possible. In fact the character is unequally developed among closely
related species, such as P. palustris and caribaea. Both produce
multinodal shoots, but the former so rarely that it should be classed as
a uninodal species, while the latter is characteristically multinodal.
The multinodal spring-shoot, however, has a certain correlative value in
its relation to other evolutionary processes that are obvious in the
genus.</p>

<p>The length of the branchlet is much influenced by different soils and
climates. In species able to adapt themselves to great changes, the
length of the internode may vary from 50 cm. or more to 1 cm. or less.
In the latter case the branch is a series of very short leafless joints
terminated by a crowded penicillate tuft of leaves (fig.&nbsp;12-b). Such a
growth may be seen on any species (ponderosa, albicaulis, resinosa,
etc.) that can survive exposure and poor nourishment.</p>

<p>The presence of wax, as a bloom on the branchlet, is associated with
trees in arid localities, especially Mexico, where it is very common.
With several species the character is inconstant, apparently dependent
on environment, and is a provision against too rapid transpiration.</p>

<p>The branchlet furnishes evidence of the section to which the species
belongs, for the bract-bases persist after the bracts have fallen away.
The color of the branchlet, its lustre, the presence of minute hairs,
etc., are often suggestions for determining species.</p>

</div>


<h3>THE SECONDARY LEAF. <a href="#plate2">Plate II</a>.</h3>

<p>Secondary leaves, the permanent foliage of Pines, are borne on
dwarf-shoots in the axils of primary leaves. They form cylindrical
fascicles, rarely monophyllous, prevalently of 2, 3 or 5 leaves,
occasionally of 4, 6, 7, or 8 leaves. The scales of the fascicle-bud
elongate into a basal sheath, dec<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>iduous (fig.&nbsp;15) in all Soft Pines
except P. Nelsonii, persistent (fig.&nbsp;16) in all Hard Pines except P.
leiophylla and Lumholtzii. Inasmuch as these three species are easily
recognized, the fascicle-sheath is useful for sectional distinctions.</p>


<h4>EXTERNAL CHARACTERS.</h4>

<p>The number of leaves in the fascicle is virtually constant in most
species, the variations being too rare to be worthy of consideration.
With some species, however, heteromerous fascicles are normal. The
influences that cause this variation are not always apparent (echinata,
etc.), but with P. ponderosa, leiophylla, sinensis and others, the
number of leaves in the fascicle is, in some degree, dependent on
climatic conditions, the smaller number occurring in colder regions. In
Mexico, for example, where snow-capped mountains lie on subtropical
table-lands and extremes of temperature are in juxtaposition, the
conditions are favorable for the production of species with heteromerous
fascicles, and the number of leaves in the fascicle possesses often
climatic rather than specific significance.</p>

<p>Among conifers, the leaf of Pinus attains extraordinary length with
great variation, from 5 cm. or less to 50 cm. or more, the maximum for
each species being usually much more than twice the minimum. Climate is
the predominating influence; for the shortest leaves occur on alpine and
boreal species, the longest leaves on species in or near the tropics.</p>

<p>The length of the leaf is complicated by the peculiarities of individual
trees and by pathological influences; as a general rule, however, the
length of leaves is less or greater according to unfavorable or
favorable conditions of temperature, moisture, soil and exposure.
Therefore the dimensions of the leaf may be misleading. It can be said,
however, that certain species always produce short leaves, others leaves
of medium length, and others very long leaves.</p>

<p>Persistence of the leaf varies with the species and with the individual
tree. But it is noteworthy that the longest persistence is associated
with short leaves (Balfouriana, albicaulis, montana, etc.).</p>


<h4>INTERNAL CHARACTERS.</h4>

<p>Since the leaf-fascicle is cylindrical, the cross-section of a leaf is a
sector, its proportional part, of a circle. Theoretically the leaf, in
section, should indicate the number of leaves composing its fascicle.
This is absolutely true for fascicles of two leaves only. No fascicle of
five leaves, that I have examined, is equally apportioned among its five
members. It may be divided in various ways, one of which is shown in
fig.&nbsp;18, where the leaf (a) might be mistaken for one of a fascicle of
3, and the leaf (b) for one of a fascicle of 6. Therefore if absolute
certainty is required, a fascicle of triquetral leaves is best
determined by actual count.</p>

<p>The transverse section of a leaf may be conveniently divided into three
distinct parts&mdash;1, the dermal tissues, epiderm, hypoderm and stomata
(fig.&nbsp;17-a)&mdash;2, the green tissue, containing the resin-ducts (fig.
17-b)&mdash;3, the stelar tissues, enclosed by the endoderm and containing
the fibro-vascular bundle (fig.&nbsp;17-c).</p>


<h4>THE DERMAL TISSUES OF THE LEAF.</h4>

<p>The stomata of Pine leaves are depressed below the surface and interrupt
the continuity of epiderm and hypoderm. They are wanting on the dorsal
surface of the leaves of several Soft Pines, constantly in some species,
irregularly in others. In Hard Pines, however, all surfaces of the leaf
are stomatiferous. In several species of the Soft Pines the longitudinal
lines of stomata are very conspicuous from the white bloom which
modifies materially the general color of the foliage.</p>

<p>Under the action of hydrochloric acid the hypoderm is sharply
differentiated from the epiderm by a distinct reddish tint, but without
the aid of a reagent the two tissues do not always differ in appearance.
The cells of epiderm and hypoderm may be so similar that they appear to
form a single tissue. In most species, however, the epiderm is distinct,
while the cells of the hypoderm are either uniform,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span> with equally thin
or thick walls&mdash;or biform, with very thin walls in the outer row of
cells and very thick walls in the inner row or rows of cells&mdash;or
multiform, with cell-walls gradually thicker toward the centre of the
leaf. These conditions may be tabulated as follows&mdash;</p>


<div class='center'>
<table summary="Secondary Leaves">
<tr><td align='left'>Cells of epiderm and hypoderm similar</td><td align='right'>fig.&nbsp;19.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Cells of epiderm and hypoderm distinct.</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>

<tr><td align='left'><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Cells of hypoderm multiform</span></td><td align='right'>fig.&nbsp;23.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The biform hypoderm is not always obvious (clausa, Banksiana, etc.)
where in some leaves there is but one row of cells. But with the
examination of other leaves one or more cells of a second row will be
found with very thick walls. Among Hard Pines there is no Old World
species with a biform hypoderm. But there are a few American species
with uniform hypoderm (resinosa, tropicalis, patula and Greggii); while,
in some leaves of the few American Hard Pines with multiform hypoderm,
the uniform hypoderm is a variation.</p>


<h4>THE GREEN TISSUE.</h4>

<p>In this tissue are the resin-ducts, each with a border of cells,
corresponding in appearance and in chemical reaction with the cells of
the hypoderm and with thinner or thicker walls. With reference to the
green tissue the foliar duct may be in one of four positions.</p>



<div class='center'>
<table summary="Green Tissue">
<tr><td align='left'>1.&nbsp;External</td><td align='left'>against the hypoderm</td><td align='right'>fig.&nbsp;24.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>2.&nbsp;Internal</td><td align='left'>against the endoderm</td><td align='right'>fig.&nbsp;28.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>3.&nbsp;Medial</td><td align='left'>in the green tissue, touching neither hypoderm nor endoderm</td><td align='right'>fig.&nbsp;26.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>4.&nbsp;Septal</td><td align='left'>touching both endoderm and hypoderm, forming a septum</td><td align='right'>fig.&nbsp;30.</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p>Among the Soft Pines the external duct is invariable in the subsection
Paracembra. It is also characteristic of the Strobi, where it is
sometimes associated with a medial duct. In the Cembrae and the
Flexiles, however, the ducts are external in some species, or medial or
both in others, without regard to the affinities of these species.</p>

<p>Among the Hard Pines the external duct is characteristic of the Old
World, there being but two American Pines with this character (resinosa
and tropicalis). The internal duct is peculiar to Hard Pines of the New
World, its presence in Old World species being extremely rare. The
medial duct is common to species of both hemispheres, either alone or in
association with ducts in other positions (figs. 25, 27). The septal
duct is peculiar to a few species (oocarpa, tropicalis, and less
frequently Pringlei and Merkusii). I have also seen it in a leaf of P.
canariensis. The internal and septal ducts appear to be confined to the
species of warm-temperate or tropical countries.</p>

<p>The number of resin-ducts of a single leaf may be limited to two or
three (strobus, koraiensis, etc.), but in many species it is exceedingly
variable and often large (pinaster, sylvestris, etc.). Eighteen or more
ducts in a single leaf have been recorded. Such large numbers are
peculiar to Pinus. Occasionally a single leaf, possibly the leaves of a
single tree, may be without ducts, but this is never true of all the
leaves of a species.</p>


<h4>THE STELAR TISSUES.</h4>

<p>The walls of the endoderm are, in most species, uniform, but, with P.
albicaulis and some species of western North America, the outer walls of
the cells are conspicuously thickened (fig.&nbsp;32). Both thin and thick
walls may be found among the leaves of the group Macrocarpae and of the
species longifolia.</p>

<p>The fibro-vascular bundle of the leaf is single in Soft Pines, double in
Hard Pines. This distinction is employed by Koehne as the basis of his
two sections, Haploxylon and Diploxylon. The double bundle is usually
obvious even when the two parts are contiguous, but they are sometimes
com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>pletely merged into an apparently single bundle. This condition,
however, is never constant in a Hard Pine, and a little investigation
will discover a leaf with a true double bundle.</p>

<p>Some cells about the fibro-vascular bundle acquire thick walls with the
appearance and chemical reaction of the hypoderm cells. Among the Soft
Pines this condition is most obvious in the group Cembroides. Among the
Hard Pines it appears in all degrees of development, being absent (figs.
24, 25), sometimes in irregular lines above and below the bundle (figs.
26, 27, 30, 31), or forming a conspicuous tissue between and partly
enclosing the two parts of the bundle (figs. 28, 29).</p>

<p>The leaf-section furnishes sectional and other lesser distinctions. It
is often decisive in separating species otherwise difficult to
distinguish (nigra and resinosa or Thunbergii and sinensis, etc.).
Sometimes it is sufficiently distinct to determine a species without
recourse to other characters (tropicalis, oocarpa, Merkusii, etc.). An
intimate knowledge of the leaf-section, with an understanding of the
limits of its variation, is a valuable equipment for recognizing
species.</p>

<h3>THE FLOWERS. <a href="#plate3">Plate III</a>, figs. 33-39.</h3>

<p>The flowers in Pinus are monoecious, the pistillate in the position of a
long shoot, taking the place of a subterminal or lateral bud, the
staminate in the position of a dwarf-shoot, taking the place of a
leaf-fascicle but confined to the basal part of the internode.</p>

<p>Pistillate flowers are single or verticillate. On multinodal shoots they
are often multiserial, appearing on two or more nodes of the same
spring-shoot (fig.&nbsp;33). On uninodal shoots they are necessarily
subterminal (fig.&nbsp;34), the lateral pistillate flower being possible only
on multinodal shoots (fig.&nbsp;35) where it is often associated with the
subterminal flower (fig.&nbsp;33). Like the multinodal shoot, on which its
existence depends, the lateral pistillate flower cannot be employed for
grouping the species. It is merely the frequent, but not the essential,
evidence of condition of growth that is more perfectly characterized by
the shoot itself.</p>

<p>Staminate catkins are in crowded clusters, capitate or elongate (figs.
36, 37), but with much variation in the number of catkins in each
cluster. In P. rigida I have found single catkins or clusters of all
numbers from two to seventy or more. In P. Massoniana and P. densiflora
a cluster attains such unusual length (fig.&nbsp;37) that this character
becomes a valuable distinction between these species and P. sinensis,
which has short-capitate clusters. The catkins differ much in size, the
largest being found among the Hard Pines.</p>

<p>In the connective of the binate pollen-sacs there is a notable
difference (figs. 38, 39), the smaller form being characteristic of the
Soft Pines. But this is not invariable (excelsa, sylvestris, etc.), and
the absence of complete data does not permit an accurate estimate of its
importance.</p>


<h3>THE CONELET. <a href="#plate3">Plate III</a>, figs. 40-45.</h3>

<p>After pollination the pistillate flower closes and becomes the conelet,
the staminate flowers withering and falling away. The conelet makes no
appreciable growth until the following year. Like the pistillate flower
it may be subterminal or lateral, but a subterminal pistillate flower
may become a pseudolateral conelet by reason of a summer-growth (fig.
40-a). Such a condition may be recognized on the branchlets of the
present, and of the previous year (fig.&nbsp;40-b), by the very short
internode and short leaves beyond the fruit.</p>

<p>The conelet offers some distinctions of form, of color, and of length of
peduncle, while in some species (sylvestris, caribaea, etc.) its
reflexed position is an important specific character. The most important
distinctions, however, are found in its scales, which may be</p>

<h3>THE CONE. <a href="#plate4">Plate IV</a>.</h3>

<p>The cone of Pinus shows great differences of color, form and tissue;
these are useful for specific and sectional distinctions, while the
gradual change from the primitive conditions of the Cembrae to the
elaborate form, structure and mode of dissemination of some serotinous
species are obvious evidence of an evolution among the species of
remarkable taxonomic range. A form new among Coniferae appears, the
oblique cone, and a new condition, the serotinous cone, both appearing
at first alone and, finally, in constant association.</p>


<h4>COLOR OF THE CONE.</h4>

<p>With few exceptions the color of the ripe cone may be classified under
one of the following shades of brown or yellow.</p>



<div class='center'>
<table summary="Cone Color">
<tr><td align='left'>Nut-brown</td><td align='left'>The stain of the walnut-husk.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Rufous brown</td><td align='left'>A pronounced reddish nut-brown.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Fulvous brown</td><td align='left'>A yellowish nut-brown.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Tawny yellow</td><td align='left'>The color of the lion.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Orange</td><td align='left'>Ochre-yellow to red-orange.</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p>These colors may be paler or deeper. They may be obscured by a fuscous
shade or may be modified by a dull or lustrous surface. The presence of
two or more of these shades in a single species and the inherent
difficulties of color description lessen the value of the character.
Nevertheless certain allied species, such as P. nigra and Thunbergii, or
P. densiflora and Massoniana, may be distinguished by the prevalent
difference in the color of their cones.</p>


<h4>DIMENSIONS OF THE CONE.</h4>

<p>The cone is small, medium or large in different species, but varies
greatly under the influences of environment or of individual
peculiarities. The character possesses relative value only, for great
variation is possible in the same locality and even on the same tree.</p>


<h4>THE PEDUNCLE.</h4>

<p>All conelets are pedunculate, but in some species the peduncle, even
when long (patula), may become overgrown and concealed by the basal
scales of the ripe cone. Articulation usually takes place between the
peduncle and the branch, sometimes with the loss of a few basal scales
which remain temporarily on the tree (ponderosa, palustris, etc.). With
P. Nelsonii, and to a less degree with P. Armandi, there is articulation
between the cone and its peduncle.</p>

<p>There are several species bearing persistent cones with no articulation.
This condition appears in other genera, such as Larix and Picea, but
without obvious significance. In Pinus, however, the gradual appearance
of the persistent cone, for it is rare, common, prevalent or invariable
in different species, and its essential association with the serotinous
cone, suggest an evolution toward a definite end.</p>


<h4>THE UMBO.</h4>

<p>The exposed part of the scale of the conelet is the umbo of the ripe
cone, a small definite area representing the earlier part of the
biennial growth of the cone. The position of the umbo on the apophysis
is the basis of Koehne's subdivision of the section Haploxylon.</p>



<div class='center'>
<table summary="Umbo">
<tr><td align='left'>1. Umbo terminal</td><td align='left'>Subsection Cembra</td><td align='right'>fig.&nbsp;46-a.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>2. Umbo dorsal</td><td align='left'>Subsection Paracembra</td><td align='right'>fig.&nbsp;46-b.</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p>Two other characters assist in establishing these subsections&mdash;the
conelet, unarmed in Cembra, armed in Paracembra&mdash;the pits of the
ray-cells of the wood, large in Cembra, small in Paracembra.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span></p>

<h4>THE APOPHYSIS.</h4>

<p>The apophysis represents the later and larger growth of the cone-scale.
With a terminal umbo the margin of the apophysis is free and may be
rounded (fig.&nbsp;49) or may taper to a blunt point (fig.&nbsp;52), and any
extension of the scale is a terminal extension. With the dorsal umbo all
sides of the apophysis are confined between other apophyses, and any
extension is a dorsal thickening of the apophysis or a dorsal
protuberance. The outline of an apophysis with a dorsal umbo is
quadrangular, or it is irregularly pentagonal or hexagonal, the
different forms depending on the arrangement of the contiguous scales,
whether of definite or indefinite phyllotactic order, a distinction to
be considered later.</p>

<p>The two positions of the umbo result from the relative growth of the
dorsal and ventral surfaces of the cone-scale. With the terminal umbo
the growth of both surfaces is uniform, with the dorsal umbo the growth
is unequal. A true terminal umbo rests on the surface of the underlying
scale, although several species with terminal umbos show the first
stages of the dorsal umbo. The umbo of P. Lambertiana or of P. flexilis
does not touch the surface of the scale below, and a small portion of
the under side of the apophysis is brought into view on the closed cone.
The cone of P. albicaulis (<a href="#plate8">Plate VIII</a>, fig.&nbsp;90) shows all degrees of
development between a terminal umbo near the apex of the cone and a
dorsal umbo near its base.</p>

<p>The growth of the apophysis may be limited and constant (strobus,
echinata, etc.) or exceedingly variable, ranging from a slight thickness
to a long protuberance (pseudostrobus, montana, etc.). The protuberance
is usually reflexed from the unequal growth of the two surfaces. With
the terminal umbo the protuberance lengthens the scale, with the dorsal
umbo it thickens the scale. It is sometimes a specific character
(ayacahuite, longifolia) appearing on all cones of the species,
sometimes a varietal form, associated in the same species with an
unprolonged apophysis (sylvestris, montana).</p>

<p>On different parts of the same cone, base, centre or apex, the
dimensions of the apophyses differ, but at each level the scales may be
uniform on all sides of the cone. That is to say, the cone is
symmetrical with reference to any plane passing through its axis. This,
the symmetrical cone, is characteristic of all other genera of the
Abietineae, and is invariable among the Soft Pines and in many Hard
Pines (figs. 47, 48, 52, 54). But among the Hard Pines there is
gradually developed a new form of cone with smaller flatter apophyses on
the anterior, and larger thicker apophyses on the posterior surface.
This is the peculiar oblique cone of Pinus (figs. 50, 51, 53),
symmetrical with reference to one plane only, which includes the axis of
both cone and branch. The oblique cone is a gradual development among
the Hard Pines; in some species it is associated as a varietal form with
the symmetrical cone, and finally, in some serotinous species, it is the
constant form.</p>


<h4>THE OBLIQUE CONE.</h4>

<p>When the oblique cone is merely a varietal form (halepensis, etc.), it
gives the impression of an accident, resulting from the reflexed
position of the cone and the consequent greater development of the
scales receiving a greater amount of light and air. But with the
serotinous cones (radiata, attenuata), the advantages of this form
become apparent. The cones of these species are in crowded nodal
clusters, reflexed against the branch (fig.&nbsp;50). The inner, anterior
scales are perfectly protected by their position, while the outer,
posterior scales are exposed to the weather. These last only are very
thick; that is to say, there is an economical distribution of protective
tissue, with the greatest amount where it is most needed. The oblique
form is peculiarly adapted for a cone destined to remain on the tree for
twenty years or more and to preserve its seeds unimpaired. Like the
persistent cone, the oblique cone finds in association with the
serotinous cone a definite reason for existence.</p>

<h3>PHYLLOTAXIS. <a href="#plate5">Plate V</a>.</h3>

<p>There is an obvious difference between the cones of the two sections of
the genus. Those of the Soft Pines (figs. 55, 56) have larger and fewer
scales, those of the Hard Pines (figs. 57, 58) have more numerous and
smaller scales, in proportion to the size of the cone. The former
condition represents a lower, the latter condition represents a higher,
order of phyllotaxis.</p>


<h4>DEFINITE PHYLLOTAXIS.</h4>

<p>On a cylindrical axis with scales of the same size, the spiral
arrangement would appear as in fig.&nbsp;62, where the scales are
quadrangular and any four adjacent scales are in mutual contact at their
sides or angles. These four scales lie on four obvious secondary spirals
(fig.&nbsp;59, a-a, b-b, c-c, d-d). According to the phyllotactic order of
the scales these may be the spirals of 2, 3, 5, 8 or of 3, 5, 8, 13 or
of 5, 8, 13, 21 etc., etc., from which combinations the primary spiral,
on which the scales are inserted on the cone-axis, can be easily
deduced. Four quadrangular scales in mutual contact represent the
condition of definite phyllotaxis. If the cone is conical, definite
phyllotaxis would be possible among all the scales only when the size of
the scales diminishes in equal measure with the gradual diminution of
the cone's diameter. Such a hypothetical cone is shown in fig.&nbsp;61.</p>


<h4>INDEFINITE PHYLLOTAXIS.</h4>

<p>On an imaginary cone of conical form and with scales of equal size
throughout, there must be more scales about the base than about the apex
of the cone. The phyllotactic conditions must differ, and the obvious
spirals, in passing from base to apex, must undergo readjustment. If the
scales at the base are in definite phyllotactic order and those at the
apex are in the next lower order, it is evident that intermediate
scales, in the gradual change from one condition to the other, must
represent different conditions of indefinite phyllotaxis, while those in
a central position on the cone may belong equally to either of two
orders.</p>

<p>A Pine cone is never absolutely cylindrical nor do its scales vary in
size proportionately to the change of diameter. Most of the scales of a
cone are in indefinite phyllotactic relation, while definite phyllotaxis
is found only at points on the cone.</p>

<p>As an extreme illustration, the cone of P. pinaster (fig.&nbsp;60) shows four
mutually contiguous quadrangular apophyses at (a), lying on the obvious
spirals 5, 8, 13, 21, at (b) four similar apophyses on the spirals 3, 5,
8, 13, and at (c) four others on the spirals 2, 3, 5, 8. Between these
three points are apophyses of irregular pentagonal or hexagonal outline,
with three scales only in mutual contact (figs. 63, 64). Such are the
majority of the scales of the cone and represent more or less indefinite
conditions of phyllotaxis.</p>

<p>The cones of Hard Pines, by reason of relatively more and smaller scales
and of a more conical form, attain a higher phyllotaxis and a more
complex condition, two or even three orders being represented on a
single cone; while the cones of Soft Pines, by reason of relatively
fewer and larger scales and a more cylindrical form, are of lower
phyllotaxis, with one order only more or less definitely presented.
Therefore phyllotaxis furnishes another distinction between the two
sections of the genus, but its further employment is exceedingly
restricted on account of the constant repetition of the same orders
among the species.</p>


<h3>THE CONE-TISSUES. <a href="#plate6">Plate VI</a>.</h3>

<p>The axis of the cone is a woody shell, enclosing a wide pith and covered
by a thick cortex traversed by resin-ducts. By removing the scales and
cortex from the axis (fig.&nbsp;65) the wood is seen to be in sinuous strands
uniting above and below fusiform openings, the points of insertion of
the cone-scales. From the wood, at each insertion, three stout strands
enter the scale, dividing and subdividing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span> into smaller tapering
strands whose delicate tips converge toward the umbo. Fig. 70 represents
a magnified cross-section of half the cone-scale of P. Greggii; at (a)
is a compact dorsal plate of bast cells; at (e) is a ventral plate of
the same tissue but of less amount; at (b) is the softer brown tissue
enclosing the wood-strands (d, d) (the last much more magnified in fig.
69) and the resin-ducts (e, e).</p>


<h4>WOOD STRANDS.</h4>

<p>The wood-strands, forming the axis of the cone, differ in tenacity in
the two sections of the genus. Those of the Soft Pines are easily pulled
apart by the fingers, those of the Hard Pines are tougher in various
degrees and cannot be torn apart without the aid of a tool. This
difference is correlated with differences in other tissues, all of them
combining in a gradual change from a cone of soft yielding texture to
one of great hardness and durability.</p>

<p>If a cone scale of P. ayacahuite is stripped of its brown and bast
tissues (fig.&nbsp;66) and is immersed in water and subsequently dried, there
is at first a flexion toward the cone-axis (fig.&nbsp;67) and then away from
it (fig.&nbsp;68). The wood-strands are hygroscopic and co&ouml;perate with the
bast tissues in opening and closing the cone. This appears to be true of
all species excepting the three species of the Cembrae, whose strands
are so small and weak that they are not obviously affected by
hygrometric changes.</p>


<h4>BAST TISSUE.</h4>

<p>With the exception of the three species of the Cembrae the inner part of
the cone-scales is protected by sclerenchymatous cells forming hard
dorsal and ventral plates (fig.&nbsp;70, a, c). In Soft Pines these cells are
subordinate to the more numerous parenchymatous cells, but in Hard Pines
the sclerenchyma increases in amount until, among the serotinous
species, it is the predominating tissue of the cone-scale, giving to
these cones their remarkable strength and durability.</p>

<p>This bast tissue is hygroscopic and, with its greater thickness on the
dorsal surface, there is a much greater strain on that side of the
scale, tending to force the scales apart when they are ripe and dry, and
subsequently closing and opening the cone on rainy and sunny days.</p>

<p>The cone, during the second season's growth, is completely closed, its
scales adhering together with more or less tenacity. In most species the
hygroscopic energy of the scales is sufficient to open the cone under
the dry condition of its maturity, but with several species the adhesion
is so persistent that some of the cones remain closed for many years.
These are the peculiar serotinous cones of the genus.</p>


<h4>THE SEROTINOUS CONE.</h4>

<p>As an illustration of the area to which the adhesion is confined, a
section may be sawed from a cone of P. attenuata (fig.&nbsp;71). The axis and
the scales that have been severed from their apophyses (b) can be easily
pushed out of the annulus (a), which is composed wholly of apophyses so
firmly adherent that they will successfully resist a strong effort to
break them apart. When immersed in boiling water, however, the ring
falls to pieces. An examination of these pieces discovers adhesion only
on a narrow ventral border under the apophysis and on a corresponding
dorsal border back of the apophysis. The rest of the scale is not
adherent, so that the seed is free to fall at the opening of the cone.</p>

<p>The serotinous cone is a gradual development, wanting in most species,
rare in a few, less or more frequent in others. A similar evolution of
the persistent cone, of the oblique cone and of the cone-tissues has
been already discussed. All these progressive characters culminate in
mutual association in P. radiata and its allies. The result is a highly
specialized fruit that should convey taxonomic significance of some
kind.</p>

<p>With all serotinous species that I have seen, some of the trees open
their cones at maturity, others at indefinite intervals. That is to say,
the seed of a prolific year is not at the mercy of a single, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>perhaps
unfavorable season. The chances of successful germination are much
increased by the intermittent seed-release peculiar to these Pines. Such
a method of dissemination must accrue to the advantage of a species. In
other words, this intermittent dissemination and the oblique form of
cone with its perfected tissues all mark the highest development of the
genus.</p>

<h3>THE SEED. <a href="#plate6">Plate VI</a>. Figs. 72-79.</h3>

<p>The seed of Pinus contains an embryo, with the cotyledons clearly
defined, embedded in albumen, which is protected by a bony testa with an
external membranous spermoderm, produced, in most species, into an
effective wing. While the seed of other genera of the Abietineae shows
no striking difference among the species, that of Pinus is remarkably
variable, presenting alike the most primitive and the most elaborate
forms among the Conifers. These differences are valuable for the
segregation of kindred species and for some specific distinctions.</p>


<h4>WINGLESS SEEDS.</h4>

<p>With wingless seeds the main distinction is found in the spermoderm,
which is entire in one species only, P. koraiensis. In P. cembra it is
wanting on the ventral surface of the nut, but on the dorsal surface, it
is adnate partly to the nut, partly to the cone-scale. The nut of P.
albicaulis and that of P. cembroides are quite bare of membranous cover.
The spermoderm of P. flexilis is reduced to a marginal border, slightly
produced into a rudimentary wing adnate to the nut.</p>


<h4>THE ADNATE WING.</h4>

<p>In P. strobus, longifolia and their allies and in P. Balfouriana the
spermoderm is prolonged into an effective wing-blade from a marginal
adnate base like that of P. flexilis. This adnate wing cannot be
detached without injury.</p>


<h4>THE ARTICULATE WING.</h4>

<p>The articulate wing can be removed from the nut and can be replaced
without injury. An ineffective form of this wing is seen in the
Gerardianae and in P. pinea, where the blade is very short and the base
has no effective grasp on the nut.</p>

<p>The base of the effective articulate wing contains hygroscopic tissue
which acts with the hygroscopic tissue of the cone-scales. The dry
conditions that open the cone and release the seeds cause the bifurcate
base of the wing to grasp the nut more firmly.</p>

<p>This articulate wing is found in P. aristata and in all Hard Pines
except P. pinea, longifolia and canariensis. The wing-blade is usually
membranous throughout, but in some species there is a thickening of the
base of the blade that meets the membranous apical part in an oblique
line along which the wing is easily broken apart. This last condition
attains in P. Coulteri and its associates a remarkable development.</p>

<p><a href="#plate6">Plate VI</a>, fig.&nbsp;72 shows the wingless seed of P. cembroides; fig.&nbsp;73
represents the seed of P. flexilis, with a rudimentary wing; fig.&nbsp;74
shows two seeds of P. strobus, intact and with the wing broken away;
fig.&nbsp;75 represents the articulate wing, whose bifurcate base when wet
(fig.&nbsp;76) tends to open and release the nut. When dry (fig.&nbsp;77) the
forks of the base, in the absence of the nut, close together and cross
their tips; figs. 78, 79 show the peculiar reinforced articulate wing of
P. Coulteri.</p>

<p>Such wide variation in so important an organ suggests generic
difference. But here we are met by the association of the different
forms in species evidently closely allied. The two Foxtail Pines are so
similar in most characters that they have been considered, with good
reason, to be specifically identical; yet the seed-wing of P.
Balfouriana is adnate, that of P. aristata articulate. P. Ayacahuite
produces not only the characteristic wing of the Strobi, adnate, long
and effective, but also, in the northern variety, a seed with a
rudimentary wing, the exact counterpart of the seed of P. flexilis.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span> In
both sections of the genus are found the effective adnate wing (Strobi
and Longifoliae) and the inefficient articulate wing (Gerardianae and
Pineae). A little examination of all forms of the seed will show that
they blend gradually one into another.</p>

<p>The color of the wing is occasionally peculiar, as in the group
Longifoliae. There is usually no constancy in this character, for the
wing may be uniform in color or variously striated in seeds of the same
species. The length and breadth of the seed-wing, being dependent on the
varying sizes of the cone-scale, differ in the same cone. They are also
inconstant in different cones of the same species, and of this
inconstancy the seed of P. ayacahuite furnishes the most notable
example.</p>

<h3>THE WOOD. <a href="#plate7">Plate VII</a>.</h3>

<p>With the exception of the medullary rays, a very small proportion of the
whole, the wood of Pinus, as seen in cross-section (fig.&nbsp;82), is a
homogeneous tissue of wood-tracheids with interspersed resin-ducts. In
tangential section the medullary rays appear in two forms, linear,
without a resin-duct, and fusiform, with a central resin-duct. In radial
section the cells of the linear rays are of two kinds, ray-tracheids,
forming the upper and lower limits of the ray, characterized by small
bordered pits, and ray-cells, between the tracheids, characterized by
simple pits.</p>

<p>The walls of the ray-tracheids may be smooth or dentate; the pits of the
ray-cells may be large or small. These conditions admit of four
combinations, all of which appear in the medullary rays of Pinus, and of
which a schematic representation is given in <a href="#plate7">Plate VII</a>. These
combinations are</p>

</table></div>

<p>This, the simplest classification of Pine-wood, is not without
exceptions. P. pinea of the Hard Pines resembles, in its
wood-characters, P. Gerardiana and P. Bungeana of the Soft Pines. The
dentate ray-tracheids of P. longifolia are not always obvious. The
tracheids of P. luchuensis, according to Bergerstein (Wiesner Festschr.
112), have smooth walls. My specimen shows dentate tracheids. There is
also evidence of transition from small to large pits (I. W. Bailey in
Am. Nat. xliv. 292). Both large and small pits appear in my specimen of
P. Merkusii.</p>

<p>Of other wood-characters, the presence or absence of tangential pits in
the tracheids of the late wood establishes a distinction between Soft
and Hard Pines. These pits, however, while always present in Soft Pines,
are not always absent in Hard Pines. The single and multiple rows of
resin-ducts in the wood of the first year may prove to be a reliable
sectional distinction, but this character has not been sufficiently
investigated to test its constancy. The wood-characters, therefore,
however decisive they may be for establishing the phylogenetic relations
of different genera, must be employed in the classification of the Pines
with the same reservations that apply to external characters.</p>

<p>Ray-tracheids with dentate walls and ray-cells with large pits are
peculiar to Pinus. Therefore the presence of these characters, alone or
in combination, is sufficient evidence for the recognition of Pine-wood.
But the combination of smooth tracheids with small pits (subsection
Paracembra) Pinus shares with Picea, Larix and Pseudotsuga.</p>

<p>Among Hard Pines the size of the pits has a certain geographical
significance. The large pits are found in all species of the Old World
except P. halepensis and P. pinaster; the small pits in all species of
the New World except P. resinosa and P. tropicalis. The Asiatic P.
Merkusii with both large and small pits is not strictly an exception to
this geographical distinction. The four exceptional species by this and
by other characters unite the Hard Pines of the two hemispheres.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span></p>

<h3>THE BARK.</h3>

<p>Bark is the outer part of the cortex that has perished, having been cut
off from nourishment by the thin hard plates of the bark-scales. In the
late and early bark-formation is found a general but by no means an
exact distinction between Soft and Hard Pines. In the Soft Pines the
cortex remains alive for many years, adjusting itself by growth to the
increasing thickness of the wood. The trunks of young trees remain
smooth and without rifts. In the Hard Pines the bark-formation begins
early and the trunks of young trees are covered with a scaly or rifted
bark. The smooth upper trunk of older trees is invariable in Soft Pines,
but in Hard Pines there are several exceptions to early bark-formation.
These exceptions are easily recognized in the field, and the character
is of decisive specific importance (glabra, halepensis, etc.).</p>

<p>Among species with early bark-formation are two forms of bark: 1,
cumulative, sufficiently persistent to acquire thickness and the
familiar dark gray and fuscous-brown shades of bark long exposed to the
weather; 2, deciduous, constantly falling away in thin scales and
exposing fresh red inner surfaces. The latter are commonly known as Red
Pines, as distinguished from Black Pines with dark cumulative bark.
Deciduous bark changes after some years to cumulative bark, and the
upper trunk only of mature trees is red. Red Pines, although usually
recognizable by their bark, are by no means constant in this character.
Oecological or pathological influences may check the fall of the
bark-scales, and then the distinction between the upper and lower parts
of the trunk becomes lost.</p>

<p class="center" style="font-size: 1.2em;">SUMMARY</p>

<p>The various characters that have been considered in the previous pages
may be classified under different heads, some of them applicable to the
whole genus, others to larger or smaller groups of species.</p>


<h4>GENERIC CHARACTERS</h4>

<p>Several characters, quite distinct from those of other genera, are
common to all the species.</p>


<ol>
<li>The primary leaf&mdash;appearing as a scale or bract throughout the life of the tree.</li>
<li>The bud&mdash;its constant position at the nodes.</li>
<li>The internode&mdash;its three distinct divisions.</li>
<li>The secondary leaves&mdash;in cylindrical fascicles with a basal sheath.</li>
<li>The pistillate flower&mdash;its constant nodal position and its verticillate clusters.</li>
<li>The staminate flower&mdash;its constant basal position on the internode and its compact clusters.</li>
<li>The cone&mdash;its clearly defined annual growths.</li>
</ol>



<p>Pinus is also peculiar in the dimorphism of shoots and leaves and in
their constant interrelations with the diclinous flowers. Evolutionary
processes develop features peculiar to Pinus alone (the oblique cone,
etc.), but confined to a limited number of species.</p>


<h4>SECTIONAL CHARACTERS</h4>

<p>There are several characters that actually or potentially divide the
genus into two distinct sections, popularly known as Soft and Hard
Pines.</p>


<ul>
<li>1. The fibro-vascular bundle of the leaf, single or double.</li>
<li>2. The base of the bract subtending the leaf-fascicle, non-decurrent or decurrent</li>
<li>3. The phyllotaxis of the cone, simple or complex.</li>
<li>4. The flower-bud, its less or greater development.</li>
</ul>



<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span></p><p>Some characters indicate the same distinction but are subject each to a
few exceptions.</p>


<ul>
<li>5. The fascicle-sheath, deciduous or persistent.</li>
<li>6. The walls of the ray-tracheids, smooth or dentate.</li>
<li>7. The connective of the pollen-sacs, large or small.</li>
<li>8. The formation of bark, late or early.</li>
</ul>




<h4>SUBSECTIONAL CHARACTERS</h4>

<p>An exact subdivision of the Soft Pines is possible on the following
characters.</p>


<ol style="margin-left:2em;">
<li>The umbo of the cone-scales, terminal or dorsal.</li>
<li>The scales of the conelet, mutic or armed.</li>
<li>The pits of the ray-cells, large or small.</li>
</ol>




<h4>EVOLUTIONAL CHARACTERS</h4>

<p>The progressive evolution of the fruit of Pinus, from a symmetrical cone
of weak tissues, bearing a wingless seed, to an indurated oblique cone
with an elaborate form of winged seed and an intermittent dissemination,
appears among the species in various degrees of development as follows&mdash;</p>

<div style="margin-left:2em;">
<p>The seed</p>

<ol><li>wingless.</li>
<li>with a rudimentary wing.</li>
<li>with an effective adnate wing.</li>
<li>with an ineffective articulate wing.</li>
<li>with an effective articulate wing.</li>
<li>with an articulate wing, thickened at the base of the blade.</li></ol>


<p>The cone</p>

<ol><li>indehiscent.</li>
<li>dehiscent and deciduous.</li>
<li>dehiscent and persistent.</li>
<li>persistent and serotinous.</li></ol>


<p><span style="margin-left: 7em;">and as to its form</span></p>

<ol><li>symmetrical.</li>
<li>subsymmetrical.</li>
<li>oblique.</li></ol>
</div>


<p>These different forms of the seed and, to some extent, of the cone, are
available for segregating the species into groups of closely related
members; while the gradual progression of the fruit, from a primitive to
a highly specialized form of cone and method of dissemination, points to
a veritable taxonomic evolution which is here utilized as the
fundamental motive of the systematic classification of the species.</p>


<h4>SPECIFIC CHARACTERS</h4>

<p>All aspects of vegetative and reproductive organs may contribute toward
a determination of species, but the importance of each character is
often relative, being conclusive with one group of species, useless with
another. Characters considered by earlier authors to be invariable with
species, such as the dimensions of leaf or cone, the number of leaves in
the fascicle, the position of the resin-ducts, the presence of pruinose
branchlets, etc., prove to be inconstant in some species. In fact, as
the botanical horizon enlarges, the varietal limits of the species
broaden and many restrictions imposed by earlier systems are gradually
disappearing.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span></p><p>Variation is the preliminary step toward the creation of species, which
come into being with the elimination of intermediate forms. Variation in
a species may be the result of its participation in the evolutionary
processes culminating in the serotinous Pines, or it may result from the
ability of the species to adapt itself to various environments by
sympathetic modifications of growth, or it may arise from some
peculiarity of the individual tree.</p>

<p>Evolutionary variation is associated with the gradual appearance of the
persistent, the oblique and the serotinous cone, and of the multinodal
spring-shoot. For these conditions appear in less or greater prevalence
among the species of the genus.</p>

<p>Variation induced by environment finds familiar illustrations among the
species that can survive at the limits of vegetation and can meet these
inhospitable conditions by a radical change of all growing parts. Such
variations are mainly of dimensions, but, with some species, the number
of fascicle-leaves is affected and the shorter growing-season may modify
the cone-tissues. In Mexico and Central America are found extremes of
climate within small areas and easily within the range of dissemination
from a single tree. The cause of the bewildering host of varietal forms,
connecting widely contrasted extremes, seems to lie in the facile
adaptability of those Pines, which are able to spread from the tropical
base of a mountain to a less or greater distance toward its snow-capped

<p>The peculiarities of individual trees that induce abnormally short or
long growths, the dwarf or other monstrous forms, the variegations in
leaf-coloring, etc., etc., are not available for classification, for
they may appear in any species, in fact in any genus of Conifers. These
variations are artificially multiplied for commercial and decorative
purposes. But inasmuch as they are repeated in all species and genera of
the Coniferae that have been long under the observation of skillful
gardeners, their significance has a broader scope than that imposed by
the study of a single genus.</p>

<h2>PART II</h2>

<h2>CLASSIFICATION OF THE SPECIES</h2>


<p>The following classification is based on the gradual evolution of the
fruit from a cone symmetrical in form, parenchymatous in tissue,
indehiscent and deciduous at maturity, releasing its wingless seed by
disintegration&mdash;to a cone oblique in form, very strong and durable in
tissue, persistent on the tree, intermittently dehiscent, releasing its
winged seeds partly at maturity, partly at indefinite intervals during
several years. This evolution embraces two extreme forms of fruit, one
the most primitive, the other the most elaborate, among Conifers.</p>

<p>Two sections of the genus, Soft and Hard Pines, are distinguished by
several correlated characters, and moreover are distinct by obvious
differences in the tissues of their cones as well as in the quality and
appearance of their wood.</p>

<p>With the Soft Pines the species group naturally under two subsections on
the position of the umbo, the anatomy of the wood and the armature of
the conelet. In one subsection (Cembra) are found three species, P.
cembra and its allies, with the cone-tissues so completely
parenchymatous that the cones cannot release the seeds except by
disintegration. In both subsections there is a gradual evolution from a
wingless nut to one with an effective wing, adnate in one subsection,
adnate and articulate in the other. The different stages of this
evolution are so distinct that the Soft Pines are easily separated into
definite groups.</p>

<p>Among the Hard Pines a few species show characters that are peculiar to
the Soft Pines. These exceptional species form a subsection
(Parapinaster) by themselves.</p>

<p>With the remaining species, the majority of the Pines, the distinctions
that obtain among Soft Pines have disappeared. The dorsal umbo, the
articulate seed-wing, the persistent fascicle-sheath, the dorsal and
ventral stomata of the leaf and its serrate margins, the dentate walls
of the ray-tracheids have become fixed and constant. But a new form of
seed-wing appears, with a thickened blade, assuming such proportions in
P. Sabiniana and its two allies that these three constitute a distinct
group, remarkable also for the size of its cones.</p>

<p>Here also appear a new form of fruit, the oblique cone, and a new method
of dissemination, the serotinous cone. Associated with the latter are
the persistent cone and the multinodal spring-shoot. These characters do
not develop in such perfect sequence and regularity that they can be
employed for grouping the species without forcing some of them into
unnatural association. The oblique cone first appears sporadically here
and there and without obvious reason. The persistent cone, the first
stage of the serotinous cone, is equally sporadic in the earlier stages
of evolution. The same may be said of the multinodal shoot.</p>

<p>Nevertheless these characters show an obvious progression toward a
definite goal, where they are all united in a small group of species
remarkable for the form and texture of their cones, for a peculiar
seed-release and for the vigor and rapidity of their growth. It is
possible, with the assistance of other characters, to segregate these
species in three groups in which the affinities are respected and the
general trend of their evolution is preserved.</p>

<p>The first group, the Lariciones, contains species with large ray-pits,
cones dehiscent at maturity, and uninodal spring-shoots. They are, with
two exceptions, P. resinosa and P. tropicalis, Old World species.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span></p><p>The second group, the Australes, contains species with small ray-pits,
cones dehiscent at maturity and spring-shoots gradually changing, among
the species, from a uninodal to a multinodal form. They are, without
exception, species of the New World.</p>

<p>The third group, the Insignes, contains the serotinous species. The
ray-pits are small and the spring-shoots are, with two exceptions,
multinodal. With two exceptions, P. halepensis and P. pinaster, they are
New World species.</p>

<p>These three groups, being the progressive sequence of a lineal
evolution, are not absolutely circumscribed, but are more or less
connected through a few intermediate species of each group. The
systematic position of these intermediate species is determined by their
obvious affinities. It cannot be expected that the variations, which
take an important part in the evolution of the species, progress with
equal step or in perfect correlation with each other.</p>

<p>As to specific determinations, a little experience in the field
discloses an amount of variation in species that does not always appear
in the descriptions of authors; and species that are under the closest
scrutiny of botanists, foresters or horticulturalists, attest by their
multiple synonymy their wide variation. The possibilities of variation
are indefinite and, with adaptable Pines, the range of variation is
somewhat proportionate to change of climate. In mountainous countries,
where there are warm sheltered valleys with rich soil below cold barren
ledges, the most variable Pines are found. The western species of North
America, for instance, are much more variable than the eastern species,
while in Mexico, a tropical country with snow-capped mountains, the
variation is greatest.</p>

<p>Therefore in the limitation of species undue importance should not be
given to characters responsive to environment, such as the dimensions of
leaf or cone, the number of leaves in the fascicle, etc. Moreover, there
are familiar examples (P. sylvestris, etc.) that show the possibility of
wide differences in the cone of the same species.</p>

<p>In the following classification species only are considered without
attempting to determine varietal or other subspecific forms. But
varieties are often mentioned as one of the factors illustrating the
scope of species. Synonymy serves a like purpose, but synonyms not
conveying useful information are omitted, Roezl's list of Mexican
species, for instance, and variations in the orthography of specific
names.</p>

<li>1903 <span class="smcap">Caryopitys</span> Small, Fl. Southeast. U. S. 29.</li>
</ul>

<p>Leaves and shoots dimorphous, primary leaves on long shoots, secondary
leaves on dwarf shoots. Flowers diclinous, the pistillate taking the
place of long shoots, the staminate taking the place of dwarf shoots.
Growth of wood and fruit emanating from the nodes; buds, branchlets and
cones, therefore, in verticillate association. Leaves and staminate
flowers in internodal position, the primary leaves along the whole
length of the internode, subtending secondary leaf-fascicles on the
apical, staminate flowers on the basal part. Buds compounded of minute
buds in the axils of bud-scales, becoming the bracts of the
spring-shoot. Branchlets of one or more internodes, each internode in
three parts&mdash;a length without leaves, a length bearing leaves and a node
of buds. Cone requiring two, rarely three years to mature, displaying
its annual growths by distinct areas on each scale. Seeds wingless or
winged, edible and nutritious.</p>

<p>The Pines are confined to the northern hemisphere, but grow in all
climates and under all conditions of soil, temperature and humidity
where trees can grow. Some of the species are of very restricted range,
but others are adaptable and can cover wide areas. The sixty-six species
are distributed as follows&mdash;</p>

<p>
Eastern Hemisphere, 23.
</p>

<ul>
<li>1 exclusively African (Canary Islands).</li>
<li>2 exclusively European.</li>
<li>3 about the Mediterranean Basin.</li>
<li>2 common to Europe and northern Asia.</li>
<li>14 exclusively Asiatic.</li>
</ul>


<p>Western Hemisphere, 43.</p>

<ul>
<li>28 in western North America, of which 12 are confined to Mexico and Central America.</li>
<li>15 in eastern North America, of which 2 are exclusively West Indian.</li>
</ul>



<p>The two sections of the genus correspond with those of Koehne (Deutsch.
Dendrol. 28 [1893]) and his two names, Haploxylon and Diploxylon, are
adopted here, together with his two subsections of Haploxylon, Cembra
and Paracembra.</p>

<p>Of the two subsections of Diploxylon, Pinaster has been employed by
Endlicher (Syn. Conif. 166 [1847]) and later authors for smaller or
larger groups of Hard Pines. The subsection Parapinaster is now
proposed.</p>

<p>The names of groups, Cembrae, Strobi, Cembroides, Gerardianae,
Balfourianae, Pineae, Lariciones and Australes, are taken from
Engelmann's Revision of the Genus Pinus (Trans. Acad. Sci. St. Louis,
iv. 175-178 [1880]). The remainder, Flexiles, Leiophyllae, Longifoliae,
Insignes and Macrocarpae, are here proposed.</p>

<p class="break">In order to bring the illustrations within the limits of the page the
dimensions of cone and leaf, as shown on the plates, are a little
smaller than life. In plates X and XXV the reproductions of the cones
are reduced to 2/5 life-size.</p>

</ul>

<p>Spring-shoots pubescent; branchlets very tough and pliant. Leaves from 3
to 9 cm. long, entire, or serrulate in the southern variety, persistent
for five or six years; stomata dorsal and ventral or, in the south,
sometimes ventral only; resin-ducts external. Cones from 6 to 25 cm.
long, ovate or subcylindrical, short-pedunculate; apophyses pale tawny
yellow, or yellow ochre, lustrous, often prolonged and more or less
reflexed, thick, the margin together with the umbo raised above the
surface of the cone.</p>

<div class="range"><p>This species grows on the Rocky Mountains from Alberta in the Dominion
of Canada to Chihuahua in northern Mexico and ranges westward to the
eastern slope of the Sierras and to the southern mountains of
California. The wood, where accessible, is manufactured into lumber.
It may be seen in the Arnold Arboretum and in the Royal Gardens at
Kew.</p>

<p>P. flexilis is recognized by its lustrous yellow cones. This and the
constantly external ducts of its usually entire leaves distinguish it
from P. Armandi. From P. albicaulis, with similar leaves, it differs
by its dehiscent cone. At one extreme the cone of P. flexilis is not
unlike that of P. albicaulis, at the other extreme it approaches the
characteristic cone of P. ayacahuite, with prolonged reflexed scales.
Hence the confusion of P. albicaulis with P. flexilis (Murray,
Parlatore and others) and of P. flexilis with Engelmann's P.
strobiformis. Sargent's P. strobiformis, illustrated in the Silva of
North America, is the form of this species known as var. reflexa of
Engelmann.</p>

<p>Spring-shoots glabrous; branches and most of the trunk covered with a
smooth gray cortex. Leaves from 8 to 15 cm. long, serrulate; stomata
ventral only; resin-ducts external, external and medial, or medial, all
three conditions sometimes occurring in leaves of the same branchlet.
Cones from 6 to 20 cm. in length, pendent on peduncles of various
lengths, the peduncle often remaining on the tree after the fall of the
cone; apophyses fulvous brown, dull or sublustrous, the margin rounded
or tapering to an acute apex, sometimes a little prolonged and reflexed,
the umbo inconspicuous.</p>

<div class="range"><p>A tree of the mountains of central, southern and western China with an
outlying station on the Island of Formosa. Recently planted in Europe
and America, it has so far proved hardy. The nuts are gathered for
food and some use is made of the wood.</p>

<p>The glabrous shoots of P. Armandi distinguish it from P. flexilis and
P. koraiensis. From the latter it is also distinct in its dehiscent
cone and in its seed. The section of its leaf, with dorsal ducts often
in two positions, is peculiar to this species among Soft Pines.</p>

<p>Spring-shoots glabrous or pubescent. Leaves from 10 to 20 cm. long,
serrulate, their stomata ventral only, their resin-ducts external, often
numerous. Cones from 25 to 45 cm. long, pendent on long stalks,
subcylindrical or tapering, often curved; apophyses pale nut-brown, dull
or sublustrous, varying much in thickness, prolonged in various degrees,
the prolongations patulous, reflexed, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>recurved or revolute; seeds of
the southern typical form with a long wing, the wing diminishing and the
nut increasing in relative size northward.</p>

<div class="range"><p>The White Pine of Mexico and Guatemala grows on mountain-slopes and at
the head of ravines. It is not very hardy in cultivation except in the
milder parts of Great Britain and in northern Italy, where the forms
of central and northern Mexico have been very successful. The species
is best recognized by the prolonged apophyses of its large cone.</p>

<p>The variations in the size of the cone and in the prolongations of its
scales are many, but of far more significance is the remarkable
variation of the seed-wing, which is long in the southern part of the
range, short and broad in central Mexico, and rudimentary, like the
seed of P. flexilis, in the north. This makes it possible to establish
two well defined varieties&mdash;Veitchii and brachyptera. The three forms
of the species present a gradation from the long effective wing of the
Strobi to the rudimentary form of the Flexiles. Many of the seed-wings
of the var. Veitchii correspond, in their short broad form and opaque
coloring, with the characteristic wing of P. Lambertiana.</p>

Its southern limit is in Lower California on the plateau of San Pedro

its nuts are eaten by native Indians, and the sweet exudation, which
gives the tree its popular name, is a manna-like substance of some
officinal value. P. Lambertiana is recognized by its long cone and by
the constant dorsal stomata of its leaves.</p>

peduncle. Its leaves are also much shorter and are always erect. A
curious difference is found in the connectives of the pollen-sacs,
small in peuce (fig.&nbsp;113), large in excelsa (fig.&nbsp;110). The convexity
of its apophyses distinguishes the cone from those of P. monticola and
P. strobus. Beissner followed Hooker and named this species excelsa,
var. peuce, in the first edition of his Handbuch (1891), but in the

<div class="range"><p>A tree with gray-green drooping foliage, found, with some

is a familiar tree of American and European gardens. Madden states
that the foliage of P. excelsa is sometimes erect and is occasionally
bright green. Such variations are often met in other species of Pinus.
Usually the drooping gray-green foliage and the peculiar cone are
sufficient for the recognition of this species. The not infrequent
presence of a medial duct and the large connective are valuable aids
for identifying it.</p>

<p>It differs from P. strobus in the higher phyllotaxis of its cone, an
obvious difference that may be seen by comparing cones of the two
species of the same length (figs. 117, 119), the number of scales on

soils and climates, its early maturity and stately habit, recommend it
to the forester and gardener.</p>

<p>Mature trees of P. strobus tower above the evergreens associated with
it. It is also recognized by the color and horizontal massing of its
foliage. The cone, when closed, is very narrow; its thin flat scales
distinguish it from the cone of P. peuce, and its phyllotaxis from the
cone of P. monticola. To illustrate the possibilities of variation in
the size of Pine cones, I once collected several in Tamworth, N. H.,
on the estate of Mr. Augustus Hemenway, on the same slope and within
an area of one square kilometre. These cones varied in length from 6
to 24 cm., with all intermediate sizes. Also on each tree were cones
of various lengths, but the longest were confined to two or three
trees among the several hundred examined. Dimensions of leaves also
varied with individual trees; not infrequently the leaves of a tree
were twice the length of those of an adjacent tree. Such variations
appear in many species and in many localities.</p>

<div class="range"><p>A broad tree with a round head, similar in size and form, but not in
ramification, to the cultivated Apple-tree; growing on arid slopes and
table-lands. Its eastern limit is in southwestern Wyoming, central
Colorado, Texas, western Tamaulipas and northwestern Vera Cruz. It
ranges over Utah, Nevada, Arizona and the northern states of Mexico to
the southern Sierras of California and to the northern and southern
extremities of Lower California. It is recognized by its small cone,
which expands, when open, into an irregular flat aggregate of loosely
attached scales. The leaves are shorter than those of the other Pines
of this group.</p>

<p>The cone of this species always retains its peculiar character. The
variations are mainly in the number of leaves in the fascicle. On this
character this Nut Pine is divided by many authors into four
species&mdash;cembroides, with three slender leaves&mdash;edulis, with two stout
leaves&mdash;monophylla, with one leaf and&mdash;Parryana, with four stout
leaves. But there are intermediate forms that may be either cembroides
or edulis, edulis or monophylla etc., and Voss's reduction of the four
to a single species with three varieties seems to be justified (Mitt.
Deutsch. Dendrol. Ges. xvi. 95).</p>

pseudomonophyllous fascicles, serrulate on the two margins of the dorsal

and attaining in their first season an unusually large size. Cones from
6 to 12 cm. long, on very long stout and curved peduncles, cylindrical,
deciduous by an articulation between the cone and its peduncle, leaving
the latter for several years on the tree; apophyses dark lustrous

and Nuevo Leon. It is apparently confined to a small area near the
latitude of the city of Victoria, the capital of Tamaulipas, where its
nuts are often exposed for sale.</p>

<p>In many characters this species is unique. It can be recognized at
once by the connate leaves that form the fascicle or by the remarkable
stout curved peduncle of its cone. Such seeds as I have seen differ
from those of P. cembroides by a reddish area at one end, but this can

<h4>Pinaster</h4>

<p>Bases of the bracts subtending leaf-fascicles decurrent. Seeds with an
effective articulate wing. Umbo of the cone-scales dorsal. Leaves
serrulate, stomatiferous on all faces, the sheath persistent. Walls of
the tracheids of the medullary rays dentate.</p>

<div class="range"><p>Forty-two of the sixty-six species of Pinus are included in this
subsection. As a group they are clearly circumscribed by several
correlated characters and are more closely interrelated than the
twenty-four species previously described. The distinctions of umbo and
seed have disappeared. The umbo here is invariably dorsal, the
seed-wing invariably articulate.</p>

<p>New forms, however, are gradually evolved&mdash;the seed with a thick
wing-blade, the indurated oblique cone, the serotinous cone with its
intermittent seed-release, and the multinodal spring-shoot. There are,
moreover, new forms of leaf-hypoderm and a new position of the
resin-duct.</p>

<p>Of these new characters, the thick wing-blade attains such proportions
in the three species of the Macrocarpae that they can be grouped
apart. But the characters that finally culminate in a lateral oblique
serotinous cone are so gradually and irregularly developed that they
offer no divisional distinctions. With the aid of wood and leaf
characters, however, groups can be established which preserve the
evolutionary sequence and, at the same time, the obvious affinity of
the species.</p>

</table>


<p>The species of this subsection are very difficult, if not impossible,
to classify by the usual method, which groups all species under a few
characters assumed to be invariable and of fundamental importance.
Such a method can be successfully applied to the Soft Pines and to
some of the Hard Pines, but cannot be applied to all the Hard Pines
without forcing some of them into unnatural associations.</p>

<p>To take an example, the group Pseudostrobus, characterized by
pentamerous leaf-fascicles, appears in many systems. In this group are
placed P. Torreyana and P. leiophylla. Another group, with trimerous
fascicles, contains P. Sabiniana and P. taeda. Now there are no two
species more obviously related by important peculiarities than P.
Torreyana and P. Sabiniana; nevertheless they are, by this method,
kept apart and associated with species which they resemble in no
important particular.</p>

<p>An attempt is made here to avoid such incongruities. Groups X, XI and
XII represent different stages of evolution. In the Lariciones the
cone is symmetrical, and dehiscent and deciduous at maturity, while
the spring-shoot is uninodal. In the Australes there is a similar
cone, but the spring-shoot gradually becomes multinodal. In the
Insignes the cone is oblique, persistent and serotinous, and the
spring-shoot is multinodal.</p>

<p>These definitions state the degree of evolution attained by each
group, but not all the species of a group conform exactly with its
definition. In each group are species with a characteristic of another
group. Among the Lariciones are a few species with both symmetrical
and oblique cones, and two with persistent cones. Similar exceptions
occur among the Australes. Among the Insignes are a few species with
symmetrical cones, and two with cones that are rarely, if ever,
serotinous.</p>

<p>There is, however, no difficulty in fixing the systematic position of
these exceptional species through other characters which show their
true affinity. They are placed with the species which they most
resemble. Their exceptional characters are merely the evidence of the
evolution that pervades and unites the groups. Therefore the
definition of a group is not necessarily the exact definition of its
species, and a species is placed in a group because all its
characters, specific and evolutional, show a closer affinity with that
group than with the species of any other. </p></div>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span></p>

<h5>X. LARICIONES</h5>

<p>Pits of the ray-cells large. Cells of the leaf-hypoderm uniform.
Spring-shoots uninodal. Cones dehiscent at maturity.</p>

<div class="range"><p>This group represents the first stage in the evolution of the Hard
Pines. All the species, like the Soft Pines, are uninodal and the
cones are dehiscent at maturity, but the trend toward the serotinous
species is shown in the occasional appearance of the oblique cone as a
varietal form of a few species, and in the persistent cone of the last
two species of this group.</p>

<p>All the species of this group are of the Old World except P. resinosa
and P. tropicalis. These two are the only American Pines combining
large pits with dentate tracheids, and are the only American Hard
Pines with external resin-ducts of the leaf. </p></div>

mucronate. Cones from 4 to 9 cm. long, ovate, symmetrical or oblique,
tenaciously persistent, dehiscent at maturity; apophyses lustrous, pale
tawny yellow at first, gradually changing to a dark nut-brown, tumid,
the posterior scales often larger and more prominent.</p>

<div class="range"><p>A tree of cold-temperate and subalpine levels, growing on the
mountains of central and western China, and at lower altitudes in the
north and in Corea. It is recognized by its tenaciously persistent
cones with a remarkable change in color. It is constantly confused
with P. Thunbergii and P. densiflora, neither of which grows
spontaneously in China. From the former it differs in leaf-section and
bud (the bud of P. sinensis is never white), from the latter in the
lustre and the color variation of its cone, and from both in the

trimerous leaf-fascicles.</p>

<p>Of the two varieties of this species, densata and yunnanensis (Shaw in

<h5>XI. AUSTRALES</h5>

<p>Pits of the ray-cells small. Leaf-hypoderm biform or variable.
Spring-shoots uninodal in some, multinodal in other species. Cones
dehiscent at maturity.</p>

<div class="range"><p>This group combines the dehiscent cone of the Lariciones with the
wood-anatomy of the serotinous Pines. Also the multinodal spring-shoot
first appears here and is gradually developed among the species,
absent in Nos. 37-39, sometimes present in Nos. 40-43, and prevalent
in Nos. 44-47.</p>

<p>All the species are of the Western Hemisphere, and among them may be
found the biform hypoderm of the leaf, the internal resin-duct, and
the total absence of external resin-ducts, characters common in
American Hard Pines. The eastern species are quite constant in their
characters and present no varietal forms; the western species, on the
other hand, are very variable. This difference may be due to the even
level and slight climatic differences of the Atlantic states and to
the remarkable diversity of altitude and climate of the western states
and Mexico. </p></div>

<p>Spring-shoots uninodal, slightly or not at all pruinose. Bark-formation
early, the branches becoming dark and rough. Leaves prevalently in

attaining 45 cm. at subtropical levels; resin-ducts medial, hypoderm
sometimes uniform, more commonly multiform, the outer walls of the

<p>This species ranges from the mountains of northern Durango to the
volcanoes of Guatemala, or possibly farther south. It is found at all
altitudes where Pines can grow except on the tropical levels of
Guatemala. Its more hardy forms have been successfully grown in the
milder parts of Great Britain and northern Italy. It is felled for
lumber in many parts of Mexico.</p>

<p>This sturdy Pine and its numberless variations present the most
remarkable example of adaptation in the genus. The variations are
mostly those associated with changes of environment&mdash;dimensions of
cone and leaf and the number of leaves in the fascicle. These are so
accurately correlated with altitude and exposure, and are so
imperceptibly graded, that no specific segregations among them have
yet been successfully established.</p>

<p>The type-specimen figured by Lambert does not show the longest cone
and leaf of this species. They are better represented by specimens
which have been named P. filifolia. Such dimensions prevail in
subtropical localities. At temperate altitudes these dimensions are
much reduced, but here are found a longer form of cone and leaf (var.
Lindleyi, Loudon) and a shorter form (var. rudis,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span> Shaw). At still
higher altitudes and up to the timber-limit the var. Hartwegii,
Engelmann, with short leaves and a small nearly black cone is found.
Among these varieties there is no such sharp distinction as these
definitions imply. All dimensions of fruit and foliage and the various
brown and black shades of the cone blend into each other through
endless intergradations. A monograph of this species, by one who could
devote some years to it on the superb volcanoes and in the delightful
climates where this tree abounds, would be a valuable contribution to
science.</p>

<p>Spring-shoots uninodal, sometimes pruinose. Bark-formation early. Leaves
prevalently in fascicles of 3, but varying from 2 to 5 or more, from 12
to 36 cm. long; resin-ducts medial, hypoderm uniform or multiform, outer
walls of the endoderm thick. Conelet mucronate, the mucro often
reflexed. Cones from 8 to 20 cm. long, ovate-conic, symmetrical,
deciduous and usually leaving a few basal scales on the tree; apophyses
tawny yellow to fuscous brown, lustrous, elevated along a transverse
keel, sometimes protuberant and reflexed, the umbo salient and forming
the base of a pungent, persistent prickle.</p>

<div class="range"><p>This species ranges from southern British Columbia over the mountains
between the Pacific and the eastern foot-hills of the Rocky Mountains,
including the Black Hills of South Dakota, to the northeastern Sierras
of Mexico, to northern Jalisco and Lower California, forming, in many
localities, large forests and furnishing the best Hard Pine timber of
the western United States. It attains its best growth on the Sierras
of California and is, next to P. Lambertiana, the tallest of the
Pines.</p>

<p>Like P. Montezumae, and under like influences, it shows much
dimensional variation, and the leaf-fascicles are heteromerous, with
the larger number in the southern part of its range. Many authors
consider the variety Jeffreyi Vasey to be a distinct species; but
here, it seems to me, too much importance is attached to the pruinose
branchlet, clearly a provision against transpiration and associated
rather with a dry environment than with a species. Most observers
discover many intermediate forms between this variety and the species.
The var. scopulorum Engelm. is the Rocky Mountain form with leaves in
2's and 3's and with small cones passing into P. arizonica, Engelm., a
more southern form with small cones and leaves in fascicles of 3 to 5.
The var. macrophylla (Shaw, Pines Mex. 24), in addition to its long
and stout leaves, bears a cone with protuberant apophyses, somewhat
comparable to the intermediate forms of P. pseudostrobus var.
apulcensis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span> Shaw (l. c.). Fascicles of 6 and 7 leaves are sometimes
found, and specimens that I have collected in Sandia, Durango (issued
by Pringle, through a misunderstanding, under the name P. Roseana,
ined.) show such fascicles on the fertile branches.</p>

<p>Spring-shoots uninodal, or sometimes multinodal. Leaves prevalently in
fascicles of 3, but varying from 3 to 5, from 10 to 20 cm. long;
resin-ducts medial, sometimes with an internal duct, hypoderm biform,
endoderm with thick outer walls. Conelets mucronate. Cones usually very
small, from 4 to 6 cm. long, but with a larger varietal form, ovate to
long-conic, symmetrical; apophyses nut-brown, flat or tumid, the mucro
usually deciduous.</p>

<div class="range"><p>This species grows at temperate altitudes from Chiapas to Nuevo Leon,
associated with temperate Mexican species such as P. patula, P.
leiophylla and others, and is easily recognized by its small cone. The
variety with a larger cone (var. macrocarpa, Shaw, Pines Mex. t. 10) I
have found growing in mixed groves of P. teocote and P. leiophylla. It
resembles the latter in cone and leaf, but lacks the peculiar
character that distinguishes P. leiophylla from all other Mexican
species&mdash;the triennial cone. Some of the specimens of Hartweg No. 441
belong here, as well as Pringle's specimens, Nos. 10013, 10018,

</ul>

<p>Spring-shoots conspicuously pruinose, uninodal or not infrequently
multinodal. Leaves in fascicles of 3, 4 or 5, not exceeding 24 cm. in
length; resin-ducts internal, often with one or two medial ducts,
hypoderm biform, endoderm usually with thin outer walls. Conelets
mucronate. Cones from 5 to 7 cm. long on pliant peduncles, ovate or
ovate-conic, oblique or sometimes symmetrical, deciduous, or persistent
with a weak hold on the branch; apophyses nut-brown, flat or tumid,
often protuberant on the posterior face of the cone, the umbo usually
large and salient, forming a rounded button-like projection, on which
the mucro is wanting.</p>

<div class="range"><p>A subtropical species of central and western Mexico, growing alone or
associated with P. oocarpa, P. Pringlei and the subtropical forms of
P. Montezumae and P. pseudostrobus. It is recognized among its
associate species by its conspicuously glaucous foliage. The cone is
very variable on trees of the same grove, both in size and in the
protuberance of its apophyses. Gordon's specimen in the Kew herbarium
consists of a single detached cone and a few leaves. The leaves differ
from all that I have examined in showing thick-walled endoderm cells,
but the cone corresponds with many of my own collection.</p>

flat or tumid, the umbo often thin and, together with the slender
prickle, bent sharply downward.</p>

<div class="range"><p>This species is confined to San Domingo, Hayti and eastern Cuba. Its

<p>Spring-shoots uninodal, rarely multinodal. Buds peculiarly large, white,
and conspicuously fringed with the long free cilia of the bud-scales.
Leaves in fascicles of 3, from 20 to 45 cm. long, rigid; resin-ducts
internal, hypoderm biform, endoderm with thin outer walls. Conelets
short-mucronate. Cones from 15 to 20 cm. long, narrow, tapering from a
rounded base to a blunt point, symmetrical, deciduous and usually
leaving a few scales on the tree; apophyses dull nut-brown, elevated
along a transverse keel, the umbo salient and forming the broad base of
a small persistent prickle.</p>

<div class="range"><p>Its thin sap-wood, its very strong heavy wood of large dimensions with
abundant resin of excellent quality make this the most valuable
species of the genus. It ranges over the sandy plain that borders the
Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico, from southeastern Virginia to eastern
Texas. The northern limit is approximately the centre of the Southern
and Gulf States, with a northern extension in Alabama to the base of
the Appalachian Mountains and to northwestern Louisiana. Its southern
limit lies near the centre of the Florida peninsula.</p>

<p>Among its associates this species is recognized by its large white
fringed bud and its elongated cone. Its leaves attain, on vigorous
trees, the maximum length among Pines, but on most trees the leaves do
not differ in length from the longer forms of those of P. caribaea or
P. taeda. A peculiarity, which it shares with P. caribaea, is the
deciduous scaly bark of mature trees, constantly falling away in thin
irregular scales.</p>

<p>Spring-shoots often multinodal. Bark-formation late, the branches ashen
gray and smooth for several years. Leaves binate, from 6 to 15 cm. long;
resin-ducts external, hypoderm uniform. Conelets obscurely mucronate
near the apex. Cones from 8 to 12 cm. long, ovate-conic, symmetrical or
subsymmetrical, persistent, often serotinous; apophyses red with a
lighter or deeper brownish shade, lustrous, flat, convex or
low-pyramidal, radially carinate, the umbo often ashen gray and unarmed.</p>

<div class="range"><p>A tree ranging from Portugal to Afghanistan, and from Algeria to
Dalmatia and to northern Italy and Southern France. It is a vigorous
species in its own home, growing readily in poor soils, but not
successful in colder climates. The wood is resinous and valuable for
fuel. The turpentine industry, once associated with this species, has
gradually been abandoned for the more copious product of P. pinaster.</p>

<p>It is recognized by its lustrous red cones and by the ashen gray
cortex of its branches and upper trunk. Tenore's P. brutia (pyrenaica
of some authors) is founded on a difference in the length of the leaf
and on an erect cone with a shorter peduncle. To recognize species on
such distinctions would not be consistent with the purpose and spirit
of this discussion.</p>

long, nearly sessile, ovate-conic, symmetrical or subsymmetrical,
persistent, sometimes serotinous; apophyses lustrous nut-brown or rufous
brown, conspicuously pyramidal, the umbo salient and pungent.</p>

<div class="range"><p>A maritime tree corresponding nearly, in its range, with the preceding
species, but more hardy in cooler climates. It grows from Portugal to
Greece, and from Algeria to Dalmatia, but its area has been much
extended by cultivation. Under favorable conditions it attains large
dimensions, but its exploitation for resin and turpentine tends to
diminish its size and disfigure its habit (Mathieu, Fl. Forest, ed. 4,
611). Its rapid growth, strong root-system, and its ability to thrive
on poor sandy soil, have led to the employment of this species for the
forestation of sand-dunes in France.</p>

<p>The tree can be recognized by its long stout leaves and persistent
brown cones. Its leaf-section is peculiar in the remarkable size of
the inner cells of the hypoderm, especially in the angles of the leaf.</p>

limits of its natural range, growing readily in the vicinity of
Boston. Its short binate leaves, the persistent long prickles of its
cone, and its tough branches, combine to distinguish this Pine from
its associates. The obvious relationship of P. virginiana and P.

<p>Spring-shoots uninodal and multinodal, pruinose. Bark-formation late,

long, erect; resin-ducts medial, hypoderm of uniform thin-walled cells.
Conelets mucronate. Cones from 6 to 12 cm. long, ovate-conic, oblique,

vicinity of the city of Saltillo, in northeastern Mexico. Were it not
for the difference of bark it might be considered to be a northern
variety of P. patula with shorter erect leaves. With both species the
long peduncle of the conelet becomes overgrown by the basal scales of
the ripe cone, which appears to be sessile. With both, the cones are
in crowded nodal clusters, reflexed against the branch. They are so
much alike that earlier descriptions of P. patula included the smooth
gray bark of P. Greggii. The first correct description of the scaly
red bark of P. patula appeared in the second edition of Veitch's
Manual of Conifers.</p>

in verticillate clusters, sessile, reflexed, long-ovate, oblique,
persistent and remarkably serotinous; apophyses lustrous tawny yellow,
abruptly larger and more prominent on the posterior face of the cone,
where they are usually prolonged into acute pyramids with a small
incurved spine.</p>

<div class="range"><p>A tree of slender habit and gray-green foliage, the trunk studded with
persistent nodal cone-clusters; growing on dry mountain slopes, from
southwestern Oregon over the foot-hills of the northern mountains of
California and its coastal ranges as far as the southern slopes of the
San Bernardino Mountains. It attains its best development in the
northern part of its range, but is never a tree of importance. The
serotinous habit is more pronounced in this than in any other species.
It is distinct from P. radiata, its nearest relative, by the color of
the cone, by its smooth upper trunk and by its much smaller size.</p>

<p>The possibility of identifying P. californiana Loiseleur (Nouv. Duham.
v. 293), through a cone said to have been sent to the Museum at Paris,
may cause this name to be applied, by reason of its early date (1812),
to some existing species. Don's radiata and tuberculata, although
considered to be the same species, were nevertheless founded on
different forms of the cone. Under a very narrow conception of
specific limits tuberculata Don might therefore acquire specific rank.
These considerations seem to make it advisable to abandon for this
species the names californica Hartw. and tuberculata Gord. for the
later name attenuata.</p>

thick and thin outer walls of the endoderm-cells, both forms appearing
